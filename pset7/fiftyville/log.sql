-- Ruth | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the

--       lot in that time frame.
-- Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this
--          morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer
--          Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to
--           them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they
--           were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The
--           thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the
